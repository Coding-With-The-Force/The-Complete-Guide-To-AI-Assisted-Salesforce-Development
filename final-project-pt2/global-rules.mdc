### Global Ruleset

1) Think hard, think deep, ULTRATHINK about your task before actually executing your task.   
2) Always provide links to the documentation that you read that led you to your decisions.      
3) Create a README-TASK.md file and update the README-TASK.md file with all of the decisions you make for the tasks that I give you, and list all of the files (in the README-TASK.md file) that you create while doing the tasks I give you and a description of why you created those files.
